## DVDs

I’d recommended using sonarr + trashguides of which I believe I linked you before to organize / name the episodes

### Use makemkv

You don’t actually need to buy MakeMKV. You get full access for 30 days, after which you can uninstall and reinstall for another 30 days.

### For inspecting video/audio files

Adds a right click dialog
